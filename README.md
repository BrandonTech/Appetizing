### Steps to Run the App

• Download the project by pressing the green button labeled "< > Code."  

• Navigate to the location of the saved project and open the .xcodeproj file.  

• Once Xcode is up, select a simulator or device in the scheme toolbar.  

• Press the 'Play' button in the top left to run the app.  

• You can also navigate to the Product menu in the Menu Bar and select 'Run'.  

• To run the unit tests, Navigate to the Product menu and select 'Test'.  

• Enjoy! :)  



### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

I prioritized the UI/UX and constructed the codebase to be maintainable, readable, and scalable. I chose to focus on those areas because they lie on both sides of the spectrum when creating an app, and both need the utmost attention. As an iOS developer, I have high expectations when downloading and using an app. I always strive to create a great experience for my users, as I'd want a great experience if I were in their position. On the other side of that coin, I'd want to have a great experience every time I come back to that codebase to make iterations, implement new features, scale it, etc., and I'd want the next developer(s) to have the same great experience. So that means creating and adding to a codebase that makes doing those actions painless.

  


### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?

I spent approximately twelve hours working on this project. I allocated time to work on this project a few hours a day, either during my break or at the end of my work day. I allocated a few hours to finding the right color palette and creating the logo because I was using a new approach to obtaining a logo. I allocated a few hours researching to help me understand how to implement certain features and concepts. 


  

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach? 

One significant trade-off I made was putting off certain implementations to save time, such as caching and specific features, including accessibility, an expandable list view, and cuisine sorting.


  

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project? 

The weakest part of my project is the lack of caching. This project would be my first time implementing caching alone, as my experience lies in using external dependencies. I researched the concept, but most of my research led me to rely on URLSession's HTTP caching, which then I realized I needed more time to learn to implement it properly.


  

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.

I want to say I am profoundly appreciative of being allowed to work on this project and also being able to take my time, especially during a busy holiday season. I am a fan of the project's landing page and how detailed it is. I have learned a reasonable amount, including how to move forward in my growth as an iOS Developer. As stated in the previous question, the only constraint I ran into was implementing caching myself without relying on third-party solutions or URLSession's HTTP caching. Lastly, I wanted to give you a heads-up. There's a small mistake in the assignment submission page and email under the "More specifics around the day-to-day tech interactions:" section, where the last bullet states, "We support iOS 1g and up" instead of "We support 'iOS 16 and up". Thank you again.
